# code_aster-preCICE adapter

This adapter was implemented as part of the [master thesis of Lucia Cheung](https://www5.in.tum.de/pub/Cheung2016_Thesis.pdf) in cooperation with [SimScale](https://www.simscale.com/). Currently, only conjugate heat transfer is supported.

See the [adapter documentation](https://www.precice.org/adapter-code_aster.html) on the preCICE website and additional documentation in the `cht/` directory.

The adapter is known to work with [code_aster](https://code-aster.org/) v14.4 and v14.6 and is maintained for compatibility with the latest preCICE versions. Please [let us know](https://precice.org/community-channels.html) if you face any issues, if you find out it works with more code_aster versions, or if you would like to contribute to this project.
