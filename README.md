# preCICE-adapter for the CSM code Code_Aster

This adapter was implemented as part of the [master thesis of Lucia Cheung](https://www5.in.tum.de/pub/Cheung2016_Thesis.pdf) in cooperation with [SimScale](https://www.simscale.com/). Currently only conjugate heat transfer is supported. Documentation is available in the `cht` subfolder, and [also here](https://www.precice.org/adapter-code_aster.html).

The adapter currently supports preCICE v2.2.0 and Code_Aster v14.6.
